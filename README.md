# CanBoot_Klipper_Bridge
Guide for setting up a direct CAN bus connection between a Bigtreetech Octopus board and EBB CAN bus toolhead.
- Utilising CanBoot with Klipper "USB to CAN bus bridge" communications

## Why!?
Why do I need this guide? Why do I want to use CAN bus (other than everyone "cool" is doing it)? Why do I want to have a direct connection setup!?

As of writing this, CAN bus for 3D printing is pretty popular but alos new enough to not have clear and concise guides on setup. I initially created a PDF guide on this topic but since CAN bus evolves so rapidly, and to provide more widespread access, I have created this GitHub repo to help.

Simple put...

THIS GUIDE WILL TAKE YOU STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE DIRECT CAN BUS CONNECTION SETUP FOR KLIPPER
### Why do I want to use CAN bus?

Eveyone has their reasons, but it is best to understand CAN bus in general...befoe listing the WHY.
