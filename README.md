# CanBoot_Klipper_Bridge
Guide for setting up a direct CAN bus connection between a Bigtreetech Octopus board and EBB CAN bus toolhead.
- Utilising CanBoot with Klipper "USB to CAN bus bridge" communications

## Why!?
Why do I need this guide? Why do I want to use CAN bus (other than everyone "cool" is doing it)? Why do I want to have a direct connection setup!?
